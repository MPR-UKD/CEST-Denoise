# DeNoise
### __Noise reduction tool for MRI data - optimized for CEST-MRI__

DeNoise is a collection of Python-based scripts for noise reduction of MRI data optimized for CEST-MRI (Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfert). Currently, several established filters such as Block-matching and 3D filtering (BM3D) , Non-local means (NLM) and Principal component analysis (PCA) are implemented.

Subsequent Deep Learning based denoising methods are still under development.

To test the different methods, various synthetic data are provided. In addition, a noise generator has been implemented to systematically test the algorithms with respect to various implemented image quality metrics such as PSNR, MSE and others.

### Current Version: 0.1 (BETA)
